# Forecasting Financial Variables

This study explored modeling and forecasting of five different financial variables using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Autoregressive (VAR), and the exponential smoothing models. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests were conducted to test for unit roots in the time series.

This analysis is of relevance to the financial industry stakeholders in determining what the future of investment returns will look like. It should be noted that in general financial variables are very hard to forecast as they are more likely to experience unexpected fluctuations. It is worth mentioning that all data and professional forecasts were obtained before the COVID-19 and the oil price fluctuations drew any attention, therefore it is likely that the observed values for 2020 and 2021 differ due to these shocks to the financial markets.
